# fake-json-api
Fake JSON database to mock Rest API call. See: https://my-json-server.typicode.com

# Usage

Make any GET, PUSH, PUT, UPDATE Rest call to: `http://my-json-server.typicode.com/maltelorbach/fake-json-api/detectedAssets`.

Changes are not persistent across calls. Responses are cached, so if you change the database in this repo, it will take about 1 minute for them to be effective.
